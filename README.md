ðŸ“š **Unsupervised Learning Models Algorithms and Explanations**

ðŸ”¹ **K-Means Clustering:**
K-means clustering is a popular algorithm for partitioning data into K clusters based on their similarity. It aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and the centroid of their assigned cluster. K-means is widely used for clustering analysis.

ðŸ”¹ **Hierarchical Clustering:**
Hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters by recursively merging or splitting them based on their similarity. It can be represented as a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which provides insights into the relationship between clusters at different levels of granularity.

ðŸ”¹ **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):**
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points based on their density. It forms clusters around regions of high density and identifies outliers as points with low density. DBSCAN can handle clusters of arbitrary shape and is robust to noise.

ðŸ”¹ **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):**
GMM assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions. It learns the parameters of these distributions and assigns probabilities of each data point belonging to different clusters. GMM is widely used for density estimation and clustering.

ðŸ”¹ **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving its variance. It identifies the directions (principal components) along which the data varies the most. PCA is used for data visualization, feature extraction, and noise reduction.

ðŸ”¹ **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):**
t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that emphasizes the preservation of local structure in the data. It maps high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space, making it suitable for visualization. t-SNE is commonly used for visualizing complex datasets and cluster analysis.

ðŸ”¹ **Autoencoders:**
Autoencoders are neural network architectures used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They aim to reconstruct the input data from a compressed representation (latent space) and learn meaningful features in the process. Autoencoders are also used for anomaly detection and denoising.

ðŸ”¹ **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):**
SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three components: the left singular vectors, the singular values, and the right singular vectors. It is used for dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, and data compression.
